% general intro
Tracking of eye movements is an established measurement for many types of
experimental paradigms.
% targeted intro
More complex and lengthier visual stimuli have made algorithmic approaches to
eye movement event detection the most pragmatic option.
% problem statement
A recent analysis revealed that many current algorithms are lackluster when it
comes to data from viewing dynamic stimuli such as video sequences.
% out contribution
Here we present an event detection algorithm---built on an existing
velocity-based approach---that is suitable for both static and dynamic
stimulation, and is capable of detecting saccades, post-saccadic
oscillations, fixations, and smooth pursuit events.
% results
We validated detection performance and robustness on three public datasets:
1)~manually annotated, trial-based gaze trajectories for viewing static images,
moving dots, and short video sequences, 2)~lab-quality gaze recordings for a
feature length movie, and 3)~gaze recordings acquired under suboptimal lighting
conditions inside the bore of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner for
the same full-length movie.
%
We found that the proposed algorithm performs on par or better compared
to state-of-the-art alternatives for static stimulation. Moreover, it yields
eye movement events with biologically plausible characteristics on prolonged
recordings without a trial-structure. Lastly, algorithm performance is robust
on data acquired under suboptimal conditions that are exhibiting a temporally
varying noise level.
% general context
These result indicate that the proposed algorithm is a robust tool with
improved detection accuracy across a range of use cases.
% broader perspective
A cross-platform compatible implementation in the Python programming language
is available as free and open source software.

\section*{Introduction}\label{intro}

% \todo[inline]{\textit{make connection to studyforrest. studyforrest has
% eyetracking data. why is it necessary to have that preprocessed?}}

% The data used for this thesis originates from the open science project
% 'studyforrest'. It centers around two large data acquisition phases employing
% the movie 'Forrest Gump' as stimulus. \cite{Hanke.2014,Hanke.2016} The
% project provides a large variety of collections of data to enable fellow
% researchers to build upon existing knowledge and further extend the dataset.
% Along other measures, the eye gaze coordinates were being recorded during the
% original sessions. Contrarily to the standard automatic detection process we
% applied an adaptive algorithm to the eye movement data to provide a more
% precise computation of saccades and fixations.

A spreading theme in cognitive neuroscience is to use dynamic and natural
stimuli as opposed to isolated and distinct imagery \citep{real_world}. Using
dynamic stimuli promises to observe the nuances of cognition in a more natural
environment. Some interesting applications include the determination of neural
response to changes in facial expression \citep{Harris2014}, understanding
complex social interactions by using videos \citep{Tikka2012} and more
untouched themes such as the underlying processing of music
\citep{Toiviainen2014}. In such studies, an unobtrusive behavioral measurement
is required to quantify the relationship between stimulus and response.
Tracking the focus of participants' gaze is a suitable, well established
measure that has been successfully employed in a variety of studies ranging
from the understanding of visual attention \citep{HantaoLiu2011}, memory
\citep{Hannula2010} and language comprehension \citep{Gordon2006}.
%
Regardless of use case, the raw eye tracking data (position coordinates)
provided by an eye tracking devices are rarely used ``as is". Instead, in order
to disentangle different cognitive, occulomotor, or perceptive states
associated with different types of eye movements, most research relies on the
classification of eye gaze data into distinct eye movements event categories
\citep{Schutz2011}. The most feasible approach for doing this lies in the
application of appropriate event detection algorithms.

However, a recent comparison of algorithms found that while many readily
available algorithms for eye movement classification performed well on data
from static stimulation or short trial-based acquisitions with simplified
moving stimuli, none worked particularly well on data from complex natural
dynamic stimulation, such as video clips, when compared to human coders
\citep{Andersson2017}.
%
And indeed, when we evaluated an algorithm by \citet{Nystrom2010AnData}, one of
the winners in the aforementioned comparison, on data from prolonged
stimulation (\unit[$\approx$15]{min}) with a feature film, we found the
average and median durations of labeled fixations to exceeded literature
reports \citep[\eg][]{holmqvist2011eye,dorr2010variability} by up to a factor
of two.  Additionally, and in particular for increasing levels of noise in the
data, the algorithm classified too few fixations, as remarked by
\citet{Friedman2018}, because it discarded potential fixation events that
contained artifacts such as blinks.
%
However, robust performance on noisy data is of particular relevance in the
context of ``natural stimulation'', as the ultimate natural stimulation is the
actual natural environment, and data acquired outdoors or with mobile
devices typically does not match the quality achieved in dedicated lab
setups.

Therefore our objective was to improve upon the available eye movement
detection and classification algorithms, and develop a tool that performs
robustly on data from dynamic natural stimulation, without sacrificing quality
of performance for static and simplified stimulation. Importantly, we aimed for
applicability to prolonged recordings that lack any kind of trial structure,
and exhibit periods of signal-loss and non-stationary noise levels.
% maybe work in \citep{Hooge2018} again
In addition to the event categories \textit{fixation}, \textit{saccade}, and
\textit{post-saccadic oscillation} (sometimes termed ``glissade"), the
algorithm had to support the detection of \textit{smooth pursuit} events, as
emphasized by \cite{Friedman2018}.  These are slow movements of the eye during
tracking of a moving target and are routinely evoked by moving visual objects
during dynamic stimulation \citep{carl1987pursuits}.  If this type of eye
movement is not properly detected and labeled, erroneous fixation and saccade
events (which smooth pursuits would be classified into instead) are introduced.
Contemporary algorithms rarely provide this functionality (but see e.g.
\cite{LARSSON2015145}; \cite{Komogortsev2013} as existing algorithms with
smooth pursuit detection).

Here we introduce \remodnav (robust eye movement detection for natural
viewing), a novel tool that aims to meet these objectives. It is built on the
aforementioned algorithm by \citet{Nystrom2010AnData} (subsequently labeled NH)
that employs an adaptive approach to eye movement velocity based event
detection and classification. \remodnav enhances NH with the use of robust
statistics, and a compartmentalization of prolonged time series into short,
more homogeneous segments with more uniform noise levels. Furthermore, it adds
support for pursuit event detection. We evaluated \remodnav on three different
dataset from conventional paradigms, and natural stimulation (high and low
quality), and relate its performance to the algorithm comparison by
\cite{Andersson2017}.


\section*{Methods}\label{methods}

% Methods (3 sections; our algo, comparison to current algos, application on
% studyforrest dataset)

%\ todo[inline]{\textit{Elaborate on how the algorithm works;For software tool
%papers, this section should address how the tool works and any relevant
%technical details required for implementation of the tool by other
%developers.}}

The algorithm comprises two major steps: preprocessing and event detection.
A general overview and pseudo-code and shown in \fig{alg}.
The following sections detail individual analysis steps. For each step
relevant algorithm parameters are given in parenthesis. \tab{parameters}
summarizes all parameters, and lists their default values.

\subsection*{Preprocessing}

First implausible spikes in the coordinate time series are removed with a
heuristic spike filter \citep{stampe1993} (\fig{alg}A, 1). This filter is
standard in many eye tracking toolboxes and often used for preprocessing
\citep[\eg][]{Nystrom2010AnData}.
%
Data samples around signal loss (\eg eye blinks) can be nulled in order to
remove spurious movement signals (\param{dilate\_nan}, \param{min\_
blink\_duration}; \fig{alg}A, 2).
%
Coordinate time series are temporally filtered in two different ways
(\fig{alg}A, 3). A relatively large median filter
(\param{median\_filter\_ length}) is used to emphasize long-distance saccades.
This type of filtered data is later used for a coarse segmentation of a time
series into shorter intervals between major saccades.
%
Separately, data are also smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay filter
(\param{savgol\_\{length,polyord\}}. All event detection beyond the
localization of major saccades for time series chunking is performed on this
type of filtered data.

After spike-removal and temporal filtering, movement velocities and
accelerations are computed (\fig{alg}A, 4-5). To
disregard biologically implausible measurements, a configurable maximum
velocity (\param{max\_vel}) is enforced -- samples exceeding this threshold
are replaced by this set value.


\subsection*{Event detection}

Like NH, \remodnav is a \textit{velocity-based} event detection
algorithm. Compared to \textit{dispersion-based} algorithms, these types of
algorithms are less susceptible to noise and spatio-temporal precision, and
thus applicable to a large range of sampling frequencies. Furthermore, any
influence of biologically implausible velocities and accelerations can be
prevented with the use of appropriate filters and thresholds
\citep{holmqvist2011eye}.

\textbf{Major saccade detection}\\
%
\remodnav classifies events in a sequential procedure: The entire time series
is chunked into intervals between major saccades (termed SACC) to be able to
accommodate data without a short trial structure. Major saccades are located in
a data-driven, iterative procedure that is adapted from the NH algorithm and
based on thresholding velocities with a critical velocity value (figure
\ref{fig:alg}, 2a). This threshold is determined from the entire input data to
take global noise levels into account: Starting from an initial velocity
threshold (\texttt{velthres\_\linebreak[0]startvelocity}, termed $PT_1$ in NH),
the \textit{median} (m) and \textit{median absolute deviation} ($MAD$) velocity
of samples below this value is computed. Iteratively, $PT_i$ is updated as

$$PT_n = m + (noisefactor \times MAD)$$

where the noisefactor is user-configurable, until the difference between two
updates fulfills

$$|PT_n - PT_{n-1}| < 1^\circ/sec .$$

An illustration of this procedure is shown in figure \ref{fig:alg}, B). Though
the underlying formula is adapated, unlike the NH algorithm -- which uses the
average and standard deviations of the velocities to compute the threshold --
\remodnav instead uses the median and MAD values. The use of robust statistics
in \remodnav is more appropriate given the skewness of velocity data (see
\cite{Friedman2018}). For each resulting saccade peak (sorted by magnitude),
\remodnav detects saccade onset, saccade offset and PSOs (2c). Saccadic on- and
offset detection is adapted from NH as well. In contrast to NH, \remodnav again
relies on robust statistics, and on a local velocity threshold computation in
the temporal vicinity around a respective candidate window. By default, this is
from one second before to one second after the window boundaries.  PSO
detection in \remodnav is more detailed than in the NH algorithm. In their
paper, \cite{Nystrom2010AnData} define two mutually exclusive types of
``glissades": low-velocity and high-velocity PSOs. High-velocity PSOs display
velocities above the peak saccade threshold at least once (i.e. display a
velocity peak that would qualify it as a saccade), while low-velocity PSOs only
rise above saccade offset thresholds at least once.  Despite this distinction,
the NH algorithm does not differentiate between the two event types. \remodnav
distinguishes these, and labels the PSOs of major saccades as high-velocity
(HPSO) or low-velocity (LPSO) depending on the criterion of the NH algorithm.

Importantly, major saccade detection is terminated earlier if a maximum saccade
frequency across the entire input data is reached (2d) -- this value is
configurable (\texttt{max\_initial\_saccade\_freq}) and by default is set to
\unit[2]{Hz}.\todo[inline]{once we recall citation for this default, include a
reason}

\textbf{Between major saccades}\\
%
In a locally adaptive manner, remaining data is classified into events in
segments \textit{between} the initial major saccades, so called
\textit{intersaccade windows}. Additionally, intersaccade windows are further
subdivided into segments without any missing data. Therefore, missing data can
not disrupt event detection, and excluded segments are not labeled. An
illustration is given in figure \ref{fig:alg}, C). A saccade in these intervals
(termed ISAC) is detected using a local velocity threshold -- determined as
during major saccade detection but from the specific time window only -- and if
%
\begin{itemize}
\item its duration exceeds the minimum saccade length
\item it is within a certain minimum distance from neighboring saccades
  (default: \unit[130]{ms})
\end{itemize}
%
(figure \ref{fig:alg}, 2f). Saccade on- and offsets, and low-velocity PSOs
(within intersaccade windows termed ILPS) and high-velocity PSOs (termed IHPS)
are computed as during major saccade detection as well (2g). After saccade and
PSO detection, for all remaining unlabeled time windows longer than a
configured minimum duration (default: \unit[40]{ms}), we recompute velocities
after low-pass filtering with a Butterworth filter (default  cutoff:
\unit[4]{Hz}). Any segments exceeding a maximum pursuit velocity threshold are
labeled as smooth pursuits  (termed PURS) (gi), while everything else is
labeled as fixations (termed FIXA)(gk). Pursuit on/offset detection  employs
the same algorithm as NHs saccade on/offset algorithm, but with a configurable,
fixed velocity threshold (default: \unit[2]{deg/s})(gj).

\remodnav outputs a BIDS-compliant \citep{gorgolewski2016brain} .tsv file and
reports detected events with onset and offset time, onset and offset
coordinates, amplitude, peak velocity, median velocity and average velocity.
Additionally, it plots a time course of horizontal and vertical gaze position
in conjunction with classed labels (shown in figure \ref{fig:remodnav}).

  \caption{\remodnav workflow. Optional steps and configurable parameters are bold.}
  \label{fig:alg}
\end{figure*}

All available parameters (sorted by algorithm step) with their description and,
if applicable, default value, are listed in table \ref{tab:parameters} and
displayed in figure \ref{fig:alg}. While input required by the user is minimal
(raw data, sampling rate, viewing distance and screen size), the amount of
configurable parameters may seem large. However, this is implemented
purposefully.  The available literature on eye event detection algorithms
suggests that there is no true ``one-fits-all" solution for event detection.
There are some successful approaches using deep neural networks
\citep{Startsev2018}, but those need appropriately large amounts of suitable
training data, that may not be easily available. As evident from many
evaluations and applications of algorithms (e.g. \cite{Andersson2017},
\cite{Larsson2013}, \cite{Zemblys2018}, \cite{5523936}), different underlying
stimulation, data characteristics, or use cases make certain algorithms more
suitable than others, hard-coded thresholds and parameters either applicable or
detrimental, or potentially require changes to the default values or
parameters. For our own analyses, the default parameter values were well
applicable. But we cannot anticipate how the data from other groups or
paradigms looks like.  \remodnav therefore contains a broad range of
transparent, interpretable and adjustable parameters with default values
justified from physiological findings or biological limitations, and no
hard-coded values. This gives users an option to adjust the algorithm to their
data's characteristics, but offers a sensible starting point with defaults that
proved to work well with the different datasets we evaluated the algorithm on.
Only velocity thresholds for saccade detection are estimated iteratively from
the data. Apart from the advantage of taking noise levels into account, this
also follows the reasoning of \cite{Nystrom2010AnData} that uninformed
adjustments of this parameter can have vast consequences on saccade detection,
and, subsequently, the labeling of all other eye events.

%In the original study, Hanke et. al \cite{Hanke.2016} split 30 participants into groups of 15 and placed one half in a fMRI scanner set-up and the other in a lab setting while recording eye movements during the two hour movie stimulus. For further technical details please refer to the original article. As part of an unpublished Bachelor project, we compared different filter and saccade detection algorithm combinations. To quantify the precision of the combination, the correlation between peak velocity and amplitude of all saccades, known as the main sequence, and the inherent $r^2$ values were computed. The higher the data fit to the assumed main sequence $MS$ curve $MS=mx^n$ the more precise the filter-algorithm option. The combination of Savitzky-Golay filter and an adaptive detection algorithm by Nyström and Holmqvist proved to be most precise and was used for further analysis. The respective algorithm employs a daten-driven threshold which automatically adjusts to local noise levels. It consists of five steps including filtering with Savitzgy-Golay, peak saccade detection, saccade on- and offset determination, as well as glissade and fixation identification. Parameters used for computation were kept exactly as suggested by the authors. According to the algorithm, after detecting saccades and follow-up glissades, the left over movements between saccades were considered fixations. Due to higher noise in dynamic stimuli and the longer recording period this assumption did not hold in the studyforrest dataset. Therefore, an additional velocity limit of 6.58 $\frac{\circ}{s}$ and amplitude of 2 $^\circ$ during a fixation was integrated as these values are commonly viewed as fixation thresholds.\cite{Holmqvist.2011,Henderson.1997}

%Methods should include a brief discussion of allowances made (if any) for controlling bias or unwanted sources of variability, and the limitations of the datasets.



%\todo[inline]{\textit{brief description of the nature and amount of data released, and in which format it is released in}}
%The data is divided into lab and scanner data and released as separate text files for each movie segment per participant. This results in a set of 240 .txt files. The first step of the detection process includes disregarding biologically implausible values and blinks followed up by  Savitzky-Golay filtering. The output files display the velocity, acceleration, point in time and pixel coordinates for each sample and are released separately to enable additional calculations. These files are then further processed to detect saccades, glissades and fixations. The final output includes the typical eye tracking information on each movement event: time and coordinates for on- and offset, amplitude, peak velocity and average velocity. (peak velocity was not calculated for fixations)

% \todo[inline]{\textit{Testing and comparison --- explaining rationale of the
% compared algorithms ie they were winners in the anderson paper}}

We applied our algorithm to two datasets, each to fulfill different objectives.
First, in order to validate REMoDNaV, we used the manually annotated dataset
from the Humanities Lab, Lund University, used by
\cite{Andersson2017}\footnote{github.com/richardandersson/EyeMovementDetector\linebreak[0]Evaluation},
to see how our algorithm compared against the NH algorithm it is based on and
manual human annotation of eye gaze events. This was done to verify that
changes introduced in \remodnav do not decrease performance below that of the
NH algorithm, and to evaluate whether REMoDNaV indeed improves eye movement
detection during dynamic stimulation as intended, compared to ten contemporary
event detection algorithms. Secondly, we used our algorithm on the studyforrest
dataset \citep{Hanke2016} to see the results of dynamic stimuli under two
different noise conditions: A high-quality dataset from a laboratory setting,
and low-quality data from a simultaneous fMRI and eye gaze acquisition.  This
analysis aims to provide an estimate of the robustness of the algorithm results
and follows a simple reasoning: As the stimulus (the Hollywood movie: Forrest
Gump) is the same in both noise conditions, it should evoke similar gaze
characteristics regardless of the quality of its measurement. Should \remodnav
extract similar eye event properties, then this is a good indicator of robust
performance even under high noise conditions.

\subsection*{Evaluation of the algorithm: comparing outputs against human
coders and a current algorithm}\label{ana_1}

The dataset provided by \cite{Andersson2017} consists of monocular eye gaze
data produced from viewing stimuli from three distinct categories -- images,
moving dots and videos. In addition to the eye tracking metadata (eye tracker
sampling rate (500hz), size of the screen, raw eye gaze data, distance from
screen) and eye gaze data (coordinates), each frame was also labeled by two
human observers to assign the event they thought it was. A total of six
different labels were used, namely, fixation, saccade, post-saccadic
oscillation, smooth pursuit, blink and undefined (a sample that did not fit any
other category). A minor labeling mistake reported in \cite{Zemblys2018} was
fixed prior to the computations.

To compare the REMoDNaV results to the human coders and the performance of the
NH algorithm, we applied \remodnav to the Humanities lab dataset and followed
the approach by \citet{Andersson2017}: For one, for each stimulus category, we
computed the proportion of misclassification per event type compared to each of
the human coders, and compared human coders against each other. A time point
classified by \remodnav counted as ``misclassified" if the associated event did
not correspond to the label the human coder assigned. We limited this analysis
to all time points that have been labeled as fixation, saccade, PSO, or pursuit
by any method, hence ignoring the rarely used NaN/blinks or ``undefined"
category. In order to provide a comparison to NH and the other algorithms in
\cite{Andersson2017}, this misclassification analysis was repeated excluding
samples labeled as pursuit (as none of the algorithms classed this category).
The results of this analysis are displayed in table \ref{tab:mclf}. For the
comparison performed by \citet{Andersson2017}, the NH algorithm disagreed with
human coders in 32\% of samples for images, in 93\% of samples for moving dots,
and in 70\% of samples for videos. In a direct comparison, i.e. if smooth
pursuit movements are not taken into account, our algorithm had a lower
misclassification rate. The highest disagreement across all stimuli categories
and coders is 11.7\%. Compared to all ten algorithms used in
\citet{Andersson2017}, \remodnav displays the lowest misclassification rates in
all categories.

When taking smooth pursuit movements into account, the misclassification ratio
increases, as would be expected with the introduction of a fourth eye movement
category. Importantly, despite an increase, the misclassification rate remains
comparably low, thus still exceeding the performance of all contemporary
algorithms in \citet{Andersson2017} in the dynamic categories dots and videos.
For a comparison between algorithm and human coders classification, figure
\ref{fig:conf} displays the resulting confusion matrices with Jaccard indices
(JI) quantifying the similarity between classification decisions. The JI is
bound in range [0, 1] with higher values indicating higher similarity. A value
of 0.93 in the upper left cell of the very first matrix in figure
\ref{fig:conf} for example indicates that 93\% of frames that are labeled as a
fixation by human coders RA and MN are the same. This index allows to quantify
the similarity of classifications independent from values in other cells. While
the highest similarity in labeling (evident from high values along the
diagonal) exists between human coders, the algorithm still performs well. For
the new event type smooth pursuit, detection is very consistent to human labels
especially in the moving dot category (JI of .73 and .7, respectively), and
still good in the video category (JI of .43 and .47, respectively).

In the case of the human observers the results of each observer --- represented by either blue or red --- are superimposed onto one another. Event detection done by the algorithm additionally split saccadic events into Segment defining saccades (SD-S) and PSOs to regular and High velocity PSOs (HV-PSO)  }

%\end{figure*}

Additionally, for each stimulus category (images, dots, videos), we determined
the mean and standard deviation of the event durations per event category (fixations,
saccades, PSOs, pursuits) and the number of detected events per event category.
Based on these results, following equation 2 in \citet{Andersson2017}, we computed
the root mean squared deviations (RMSD) for the full set of algorithms, human coders,
and REMoDNav. The RMSD is proposed by \cite{Andersson2017} as a single similarity
measure of distribution parameters to rank algorithms according to their similarity
to human coders in three dimensions. As \citet{Andersson2017} point out, this measure
ensures that we do not only evaluate performance on a sample-by-sample classification
similarity, but also evaluate whether an algorithm detects similar event counts and
duration distributions.
The RMSD measure has a lower bound of 0 and higher values denote
higher deviations, but for a thorough explanation of the measure and the procedures
necessary for its computation, please refer to the original publication by
\cite{Andersson2017}. By computing the RMSD of \remodnav within the original set
of data from \citet{Andersson2017}, we are able to compare the similarity of the
three distribution parameters produced by \remodnav to human labeling and those of
the other algorithms, and thus rank \remodnav within the set of algorithms used in
\citet{Andersson2017}.
For a more straightforward interpretation of the RMSD measure, we converted
RMSDs per event and stimulus category into ranks (where 0 is the best).
The results of the RMSD computations are summarized in tables \ref{tab:rmsd_fix},
\ref{tab:rmsd_sac}, \ref{tab:rmsd_pso} and \ref{tab:rmsd_pur}.
The "best" algorithm with regard to saccade and PSO detection in \cite{Andersson2017}
was the ``LNS" algorithm by \cite{Larsson2013}. \remodnav performs comparable to
``LNS" for saccades: Across stimulus categories, ``LNS" achieves a mean rank of $2.0$,
while \remodnav achieves a mean rank of $3.3$. For PSOs, across
stimulus categories, ``LNS" has a mean rank of $2.3$, while \remodnav achieves a
mean rank of $2.0$.
In the original set, different algorithms performed best for fixation detection
given the category. NH performed best for images  and videos, but worst for dots.
In our evaluation, \remodnav outperforms all other
algorithms in the dots category, and achieves rank 5 and 6 for videos and images,
respectively. That is, for fixation detection in videos and images, \remodnav
performs in the middle range. Across all stimulus and event categories,
\remodnav achieves a median ranking of $3.0$ (both with and without inclusion of
its ranks for smooth pursuit detection). Thus, \remodnav detects the number
of events and their duration distribution consistently similar to human coders,
especially so for saccades and PSOs, and fixations in the dots category.

The combined results of the analyses on the dataset used by
\citet{Andersson2017} demonstrate that \remodnav yields the highest congruency
to manual human annotation in any stimulus category on a sample-by-sample basis
compared to ten contemporary algorithms when detecting fixations, saccades,
and post-saccadic oscillations. Its performance stays good, and exceeds all other
algorithms performance in the dots and video category, when including smooth
pursuit detection as well. In this regard, the results reveal that REMoDNaVs
performance equals or exceeds those of the original NH. Taking the number of events
and their duration distribution into account, REMoDNaVs performance stays good.
Importantly \remodnav performs similar to human coders in almost all event
categories and stimulus types. NH outperforms it only for fixation detection
in the image and video category, however, in these categories \remodnav still
classifies comparatively well. Thus, \remodnav does improve the NH algorithm
in aspects that were  suboptimal, but does not diminish performance in NHs strong points.

Given that \remodnav yields biologically plausible results for dynamic
stimulation as indicated by the previous results, we determined whether it is
capable of analyzing data from dynamic stimulation without a trial structure.
For this, we applied it to the high quality eye tracking dataset obtained from
15 subjects watching the movie in a laboratory setting. This analysis further
serves as a base line to compare results obtained from a lower quality
recording to. Eye movements in this high-quality dataset were recorded with an
Eyelink 1000 with a standard desktop mount (software version 4.51; SR Research
Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and a sampling rate of 1000Hz. The movie
stimulus was presented on a $522$x$294$mm LCD monitor at a resolution of $1920$
x $1280$px at a viewing distance of 85cm \citep{Hanke2016}.  The top panel in
figure \ref{fig:remodnav} displays the performance of \remodnav for a high
quality data sample. An individual main sequence for a lab subject is
displayed in the bottom right panel in figure \ref{fig:overallComp}. In order
to compare event detection between high and low quality sample, we computed
the event distribution parameters per event type and movie run. Figure
\ref{fig:dist} displays these parameters for the high quality dataset.

\subsection*{Low-quality data}\label{ana_3}

In order to determine the robustness of \remodnav to noise, in a last step, we
applied it to the low quality eye tracking dataset of the studyforrest
publication. This data was recorded with a different Eyelink 1000 (software
version 4.594) equipped with an MR-compatible telephoto lens and illumination
kit (SR Research Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at $1000$Hz during
simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The movie was presented at a viewing distance of
$63$cm on a 26cm ($1280$ x $1024$px) LCD screen in 720p resolution at full
width. The eye tracking camera was mounted outside the scanner bore and
recorded the participants left eye at a distance of about 100cm
\citep{Hanke2016}.  The lower data quality in this dataset is evident from a
generally higher amount of data loss and a larger spatial uncertainty (see
\citet{Hanke2016} for details on data quality). As the stimulus material was
the same between the high and low quality data sample, \remodnav demonstrates
robust performance if the characteristics of extracted events within the low
dataset correspond to those obtained from the previous high quality data
sample.

% N+H describe: "Data quality is related to accuracy, precision, percentage of
% data loss, perhaps in addition to a subjective rating from the person
% responsible for the recording"

Figure \ref{fig:remodnav} displays the performance of \remodnav for a low
quality data sample in the bottom row.  As evident in both panels, periods with
data loss do not interfere with the detection of eye movement events in their
vicinity beyond the border region of data loss that is masked during
preprocessing. The detection of saccades corresponds to the velocity peaks in
the time series. An individual main sequence for an MRI subject is displayed
in the top right panel in figure \ref{fig:overallComp}. Lastly, the left column in figure
\ref{fig:overallComp} shows all events produced from both datasets. Figure \ref{fig:dist}
displays the distribution parameters per event type and movie run for the low
quality dataset.
All together, figures \ref{fig:remodnav} and
\ref{fig:overallComp} illustrate a high similiarity between performance in high
and low quality datasets. In both cases, the main sequences follow the known
peak-velocity -- amplitude relationship of saccades. It is noteable that the
MRI sample displays fewer saccades of the shortest range. Given the higher
spatial uncertainty in this dataset, this is unsurprising: the eye tracker
likely was not able to capture these small eye movements under the low-light
conditions. Apart from this aspect, both main sequences are comparable. Given
that \remodnav classifies data from dynamic stimulation well, and that results
on low and high quality data yield similar biologically plausible results, the
performance seems to be robust even under high noise conditions.

The largest amount of saccades is very close to minimum duration. The assumed shape of the distribution indicates a gradual decrease to the left, implying the possibility of a number of shorter, yet disregarded saccades. This loss of data can easily be fixed by choosing a less conservative duration threshold. There are many different subjective opinions on minimum saccadic duration, ranging from 10 ms \cite{Duchowski.2007} to 15 ms \cite{Smith.2013}. A more objective approach was provided by Carpenter in 1988 who found a mathematical relation between duration and amplitude of saccades \cite{Carpenter.1988}: $duration=2.2\cdot{}amplitude+21$. According to this equation there are no saccades of less than 21 $ms$. Therefore, a minimum duration of 21 $ms$ was chosen as threshold.}

%\caption[]{Movie segment analysis for glissades and fixations, showing mean values for different metrics over every test subject per segment, mean value of duration, amplitude, velocity, and number of fixations. Since glissade durations group around the cut off value of 40, it seems that most movements would have been longer than that. This indicates, that the threshold for glissade detection is too low, perceivably because the data used had a higher level of baseline noise than in the experiment by Nyström and Holmqvist.{\cite{Nystrom.2010}} Fixation durations range around a mean value of 420.42 $ms$. Typical values for fixations rarely exceed 400 $ms$. However, the significantly longer fixation durations align with the rest of the eye movements, as saccades were accordingly shorter than typical values suggest. Human gaze in general is preferably directed at the center of the stimulus {\cite{Buswell.1935,Parkhurst.2002}} and the pull towards the center was proven to be strongest in professionally cut Hollywood movie trailers when compared with natural scenes or static images. {\cite{Dorr.2010}} These findings supports the assumption, that participants mainly focused on the center of the screen, which is backed uo by the data. Fixations include small microsaccades, tremor and slow drifts, which allow the viewer to gradually explore the movie stimulus while staying within fixation parameter boundaries.}

As mentioned in the original study,\footnote{\cite{Hanke.2016}} a large amount of data was lost in their recording session due to signal loss, leaving too little information to detect enough saccades for valid correlation measures. Although there are slight differences in accuracy for the scanner data, the precision level prevails similarly high as for the lab. In direct comparison to the lab data, with a t-test criterion of 0.05, 3 movie segments do not show significant differences in detection accuracy.

\section*{Conclusion}\label{con}

Based on the adaptive, velocity-based algorithm for fixation, saccade, and
glissade detection by \cite{Nystrom2010AnData}, we have developed a novel,
robust algorithm for the classification of various eye movements in eye
tracking data from dynamic stimulation.  The combined results from all analyses
are encouraging. Based on data from dynamic and static stimulation from the
Andersson dataset, \remodnav performs well and even outperforms contemporary
algorithms, and this is especially true for dynamic stimulation. Therefore, we
are confident that \remodnav is currently a good choice for event detection
from eye gaze data obtained during dynamic stimulation.  Furthermore, the
algorithm yields similar, and thus robust, results for high and low quality
data. We specifically developed \remodnav to yield robust results with dynamic
stimulation, in particular noisy data such as the eye tracking data recorded
simultaneously to fMRI acquisition. These results confirm that \remodnav is
well able to detect eye movements from dynamic stimulation, even when the
quality of data is low. Therefore, the algorithm is a promising tool for
research paradigms with dynamic stimuli where lower data quality is an inherent
property of the acquisition procedure, such as simultaneous fMRI and eye gaze
recordings, or usage of remote eye trackers.  Furthermore, the algorithm proved
to be well applicable to other types of stimulation. Its classification
performance on static images was good. This demonstrates that our changes to
the original NH algorithm did not interfere with its performance on its strong
points. Lastly, \remodnav is a user-friendly tool with options for to customize
it to individual use cases. It is OS independent, uses only freely available
software, is easy installable, provides simple command-line execution, and is
ready-to-use without manual labeling or other forms of training data being
required. As such, REMoDNaV is a versatile tool that provides researchers with
a robust method to classify eye movements obtained from different types of
stimulation.

Just as \cite{Andersson2017}, we considered human annotations to be a gold
standard in event detection when we compared different algorithms performances.
The implications of the obtained results from this comparison are hence only
valid if this assumption is warranted. Some authors voice concern about human
annotation, e.g. \cite{5523936}, as for the potential of biases that limit
generalizability. However, \cite{Hooge2018} concluded that - despite obvious
variability between human annotations - manual labeling is certainly important
at least in algorithm validation as we undertook it in our study. Continuing in
the same vein, the \remodnav algorithm is - as all event detection algorithms -
far from perfect. Despite superior performance during dynamic stimulation
compared to other algorithms, the results do not mirror human annotations
exactly. Therefore, as with any other algorithm, we recommend that every user
should at least eye-ball their results for plausibility. One straightforward
way to do this is to study the classification performance as shown in figure
\ref{fig:remodnav}. The \remodnav module will provide such a plot automatically
for every detection task, enabling researchers to detect implausible results
early on

\todo[inline]{There are a number of (some very recent) ML approaches
  (Startsev,2018; Komogortsev,2010) that perform well. We should acknowledge
  that but also find arguments to justify our approach. One advantage of
  \remodnav is how accessible and readily usable it is. To underline this, I
  propose we update the README.md on Github similarly to
  https://github.com/MikhailStartsev/deep\_em\_classifier in that we provide a
  use case/tutorial: what is the input/how should it look like, what is the
  command line call, how does the output look like. I think it is a great
  advantage of \remodnav that we work with more "typical" file formats. Also,
  \remodnav does not need training, and hence no extensive labeled data as
  training sets (that could be tedious to create, or not fitting to exact use
  case if taken from e.g. open datasets)}


% \section*{Notes} % Optional - only if NO new datasets are included

% This section is required if the paper does not include novel data or
% analyses.  It allows authors %to briefly summarize the key points from the
% article.

%\todo[inline]{from andersson: How does the number of detected events and their
%  durations vary with the choice of an algorithm? How similar are the events
%  detected by algorithms compared to events manually identified by human
%  experts? How similar are algorithms and humans in a simple sample-by-sample
%  comparison, which is the most human-like? How similar are our two human
%  coders? Are they interchangeable, or will the event detection process depend
%  on the human experts we use?  Does the algorithm – human or human – human
%  similarity depend on the stimuli used for eliciting the eye movement data,
%  i.e. will it differ between static and dynamic stimuli?  What are the
%  consequences of trying to detect events in the presence of smooth pursuit
%  using improper, i.e. not designed to handle smooth pursuit, algorithms? Is
%  this a serious violation, or will such a use provide acceptable
%  approximations of the properties of the true (human-identified) events?  How
%  congruent are different evaluation techniques, such as similarity based on
%  event durations, compared to similarity based on Cohen's Kappa?  Given that
%  algorithms do not classify identically with human experts, what types of
%  deviating classifications do the algorithms do? Are the deviations random, or
%  do they indicate a clear bias in some direction? What area should developers
%  focus on improving, to gain the highest marginal improvement (i.e.,
%  similarity to humans) of the algorithm?  }

\section*{Software availability}

The latest version of \remodnav can be installed from PyPi via \texttt{pip
install remodnav}. It is recommended to use a dedicated virtualenv. The source
code of the software can be found on Github \\
(https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/remodnav). All bugs, concerns and
enhancement requests for this software should be submitted via Github.
Questions with regard to REMoDNaV can be submitted to NeuroStars.org with a
\texttt{remodnav} tag. NeuroStars.org is a platform similar to StackOverflow
but dedicated to neuroinformatics.  \remodnav is released under MIT license.

\todo[inline]{Apart from the TODOs in the document, Adina also adds these
general ones below}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lets discuss which figures we want to include in the paper - I added drafts of figures that can serve as a placeholder and base for a discussion.
\item I'm not up to date which analyses are yet missing - conversations with mih and Asim yielded conflicting information ;-) To spare me unnecessary work, I did not do anything that might need to be done (RMSD, Cohens Kappa, event characteristic tables) until we maybe get together and settle on necessary missing statistics.
\item The tables and confusion matrices need to be potentially adjusted to the minor changes introduced in this PR: https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/remodnav/pull/4
\item I did not yet add any text/description about the various main sequence plots. Maybe we should decide which ones to use as a start.
\item minor: standardize how we call things throughout the manuscript (e.g. $^\circ/sec$ or $deg/sec$)
\end{itemize}
